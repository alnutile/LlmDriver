    "response": "\nThe sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, which occurs when sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere. The sunlight encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, which scatter the light in all directions.\n\nThe shortest wavelengths of light, such as violet and blue, are scattered more than longer wavelengths, such as red and orange, due to their smaller wavelength. This is known as Rayleigh scattering. As a result, the blue light is dispersed throughout the atmosphere, giving the sky its blue appearance.\n\nThe reason why the sky appears blue instead of other colors is because our eyes are most sensitive to blue light. The human eye has cells in the retina that are most sensitive to light in the blue range of the visible spectrum, which allows us to see blue light more clearly than other colors. This is why the blue light is more prominent in the sky, giving it its characteristic blue color.\n\nIt's worth noting that the appearance of the sky can vary depending on several factors, such as the time of day, the amount of dust and water vapor in the atmosphere, and the angle of the sunlight. For example, during sunrise and sunset, the sky can take on hues of red, orange, and pink due to the scattering of light by atmospheric particles.",
