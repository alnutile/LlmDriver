        "content": "\nThe sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. This occurs when sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere and encounters tiny molecules of gases, such as nitrogen and oxygen. These molecules scatter the light in all directions, but they scatter shorter (blue) wavelengths more than longer (red) wavelengths.\n\nAs a result of this scattering, the blue light is dispersed throughout the atmosphere, giving the sky its characteristic blue color. The red light, on the other hand, passes through the atmosphere mostly unscattered and reaches our eyes as sunlight, appearing orange or red at sunset.\n\nThe reason why we see the sky as blue during the daytime is because the sunlight is scattered in all directions by the tiny molecules of gases in the atmosphere, and the blue light is reflected back to our eyes. The blue color is also affected by the scattering of light by dust particles and pollutants in the atmosphere, which can make the sky appear more blue or gray depending on the location and time of day.\n\nIt's worth noting that the color of the sky can vary depending on the time of day, atmospheric conditions, and location. For example, during sunrise and sunset, the sky can take on hues of red, orange, and pink due to the angle of the sunlight and the scattering of light by particles in the atmosphere."
